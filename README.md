VIVACE is another CCEx project in the field of artificial intelligence and user interface.

Here is what the acronym stands for:

-Virtual Intelligence: An artificial intelligence's interface meant to receive input and supply information respectively from and to the user.

-Virtue: The virtue of a virtual intelligence is its ability to process information faster, better and with more potentialities than a human being on his own.

-Assisted Computer Experience: The VI (virtual intelligence) drastically enhances the computer user's experience (productivity, usability, information accessibility, eye candy, etc...).

But the better part about this project is that VIVACE is meant to use pre-existing hardware such as current or averagely old computers and their peripherals to achieve its goals.

VIVACE's GUI or Graphical User Interface’s appearance would be of glass (as in matter), transparent and superposed to the OS’ (Operating System) GUI or Desktop Environment, and it would use all available captors, sensors and peripherals such as webcams, microphones, temperature sensors, keyboards, mice, Fan speed sensors and other possible PC or Mac extensions to get an awareness of the user’s environment both inside the Operating System and exterior to it in the physical world to help the user in his daily tasks.

Internet would be used too to get information about the location and other parameters of the user in order to improve his experience, meteorological information could then be displayed to him, as well as paths to his destinations when traveling or moving away from the computer, like what is already available in such Personal Assistants as Siri on the iOS and Cortana on Windows for example.

The Webcam for instance could be used for facial recognition to unlock a previously locked OS session after a period of inactivity or if VIVACE detects the user has left the computer via the webcam or microphone (if VIVACE doesn’t sense any sounds anymore).

The application would come free and open source for Linux, and commercialized for Windows and MacOS for a fixed fee that should be decided later.

Python will be used as a main programming language and portions of C could be used to extend Python for performance reasons if need be.
